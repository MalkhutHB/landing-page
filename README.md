# landing-page
This is a project from the odin project to build the landing page matching the design of the 
provided image (in the image folder and labled as 01.png). While thr project does encourage 
you to steer from the design and mess with adding content/images of your own, I found it fun
to try and match the document as closely as possible, especially because I already liked the 
aesthetic of the design.

The main skill that this exercise practiced was using flexbox. I was also a bit concerned with 
making sure the page scaled correctly. I haven't learned how to make websites work on both 
desktop and mobile screen sizes yet, but I did still encounter some scaling issues that I fixed mainly
by putting everything (that needed it) into a divider which had a set width. This way the website
maintains it's proportions when zooming out, and when zooming in to an extent. This constant width
design matches what I observed while looking at other websites for inspiration, such as apple.com
and developer.mozilla.org. I also noticed on both websites how some content would completely change
or how multiple butttons would collapse under a single menu button when you zoom in enough. I think this has something to do with "mobile website" vs "desktop website" designs and how you can have two layouts for your website to switch between, and I am eager to learn how to do that soon.
